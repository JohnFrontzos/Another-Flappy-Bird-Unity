# Another Flappy Bird

![Gameplay](gameplay.gif)

This project, titled "Another Flappy Bird," is a Flappy Bird game clone developed using the Unity game engine. It was created as a part of a challenge to develop a popular game from scratch, without any prior knowledge of Unity or game development. The aim of this project is to showcase the learning journey and progress made throughout the development process.

## Game Description

In "Another Flappy Bird," the player takes control of a bird character and must navigate it through a series of pipes without touching them. The bird automatically moves forward, and the player's objective is to make it flap its wings at the right time to gain height and avoid collisions with the pipes.

## Gameplay

The gameplay mechanics of this Flappy Bird clone are similar to the original game. The player controls a bird character and must navigate it through a series of pipes without touching them. The bird automatically moves forward, and the player can make it flap its wings to gain height and avoid collisions.

To control the bird, you can use the following inputs:

- **Mouse Click**: Click the left mouse button to make the bird flap its wings.
- **Spacebar**: Press the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings.

Your objective is to survive for as long as possible and achieve a high score by passing through as many pipes as you can.

## Features

The game incorporates the following features:

- Simple yet addictive gameplay mechanics similar to the original Flappy Bird game.
- Realistic physics for bird movement and pipe collisions.
- Randomly generated pipes for a dynamic and challenging experience.
- Sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.
- Easy-to-understand controls using mouse clicks or spacebar presses.

## TODOs

Here are some next features that could be implemented as future enhancements to "Another Flappy Bird":

- **Score Tracking**: Score tracking system to keep track of the player's progress and high score records.
- **Level progression**: Implement a system where the difficulty increases as the player progresses through levels. This could involve faster scrolling pipes or narrower gaps between them.
- **Leaderboard**: Add a leaderboard system to track and display high scores achieved by players. This could be implemented locally or integrated with an online leaderboard service.
- **Mobile Portrait screen**: Optimize the game for mobile devices and implement potrait screen for a seamless mobile gaming experience.
- **Tutorial mode**: Create a tutorial mode or in-game instructions to help new players understand the game mechanics and controls more easily.

## Getting Started

To run "Another Flappy Bird" on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open the project in Unity using a compatible version (recommended: Unity 2019.4.20f1 or later).
3. Ensure that you have the necessary components installed for Unity to run (e.g., Android Build Support for building to Android devices).
4. Once the project is loaded, navigate to the "Scenes" folder and open the "Game" scene.
5. In the Unity editor, click the "Play" button to start the game in the Unity Player.

## Learning Journey

This project was developed as a challenge to learn Unity and game development from scratch. No prior experience or knowledge was available before starting this project. Throughout the development process, various skills and concepts were learned, including:

- Introduction to Unity's interface and project setup.
- Understanding game objects, components, and the Unity scene hierarchy.
- Implementing physics-based movement for the bird character.
- Creating and animating 2D assets using Unity's Sprite Renderer.
- Handling user input to control the bird's movement.
- Implementing collision detection and managing game states.
- Designing and generating random pipes for gameplay variety.
- Incorporating sound effects and background music using Unity's Audio Source component.
- Building and testing the game on different platforms.

This project serves as a testament to the learning potential of taking on new challenges and exploring unfamiliar territories.
